            <p>Delving deeper, we now examine how the creators behind the scenes—directors—shape the stories that lead us toward happy or tragic endings.</p>

            <h4>Directors and Their Preferred Endings</h4>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px;align-items: center;">
                <p style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px; display: flex; align-items: center;">
                    Our investigation begins by analyzing directors’ average ending scores. The data reveals that most directors cluster around a neutral midpoint—an average score near zero. This suggests a balanced approach: many directors neither strongly favor consistently happy endings nor lean exclusively toward darker resolutions. Instead, their filmographies often span a spectrum of emotional finales.
                </p>
                <iframe src="../assets/img/rq3/director_avg_score.html" style="flex: 2; min-width: 400px; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>
                Yet not all creators follow this balanced pattern. Certain directors stand out as outliers, firmly staking their claim at either end of the emotional spectrum. Some craft uplifting narratives that leave the audience smiling, while others embrace ambiguity or tragedy, leaving viewers with haunting afterthoughts. Below, we examine two such contrasting figures.
            </p>

            <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 40px; align-items: flex-start;">
                <!-- Happy Ending Director -->
                <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="https://ntvb.tmsimg.com/assets/assets/153740_v9_bc.jpg" alt="Bobby Farrelly" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border-radius: 10px;">
                    <h5>Bobby Farrelly</h5>
                    <p>
                        Bobby Farrelly, celebrated for his comedic and uplifting films, often pairs humor with heartfelt resolutions. From iconic hits like <em>“There’s Something About Mary”</em> to other feel-good comedies, Farrelly’s body of work consistently embraces a more joyful conclusion, leaving audiences with warm smiles and a sense of lighthearted relief.

                <!-- Bad Ending Director -->
                <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Kathryn_Bigelow_by_David_Shankbone.jpg/1200px-Kathryn_Bigelow_by_David_Shankbone.jpg" alt="Kathryn Bigelow" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border-radius: 10px;">
                    <h5>Kathryn Bigelow</h5>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, Kathryn Bigelow channels intensity and realism, often focusing on the weightier side of the human condition. Her films, including <em>“The Hurt Locker”</em> and <em>“Zero Dark Thirty”</em>, tend toward more somber conclusions that prompt reflection and underscore the complexities of modern conflict.

            <h4>How Varied Are Directors' Storytelling Styles?</h4>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px;align-items: center;">
                <iframe src="../assets/img/rq3/director_score_variance.html" style="flex: 2; min-width: 400px; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
                <p style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px; display: flex; align-items: center;">
                    Beyond their preferred tone, how consistent are directors in the types of endings they produce over time? The variance in their ending scores offers insight. Many directors exhibit moderate variance, implying they can shift subtly between tones, yet remain within a familiar creative comfort zone.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                On one hand, there are directors with high variance, who explore a wide emotional landscape—from whimsical cheer to resonant tragedy—keeping audiences engaged through unpredictability. On the other hand, certain directors show extremely low variance, reliably delivering endings cut from the same thematic cloth. Let’s look at two such examples to understand these differing narrative patterns.
            </p>

            <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 40px; align-items: flex-start;">
                <!-- High Variance Director -->
                <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/michael_winterbottom.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1" alt="Bobby Farrelly" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border-radius: 10px;">
                    <h5>Bobby Farrelly</h5>
                    <p>
                        Interestingly, Farrelly not only leans toward uplifting endings but also demonstrates a willingness to vary narrative tone across his oeuvre. This flexibility allows him to traverse comedic, dramatic, and heartfelt territory, presenting a tapestry of emotions that prevents his work from becoming predictable.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Low Variance Director -->
                <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="https://images.mubicdn.net/images/cast_member/2217/cache-206-1609536785/image-w856.jpg" alt="Ken Loach" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border-radius: 10px;">
                    <h5>Ken Loach</h5>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, Ken Loach maintains a tight thematic focus on social realism. Films like <em>“I, Daniel Blake”</em> continuously highlight the struggles of the working class. This unwavering narrative approach ensures a consistent tone—often somber and thought-provoking—that reflects his well-defined artistic vision.

            <h4>The Sweet Spot for Commercial Success</h4>
            <iframe src="../assets/img/rq3/director_avg_score_vs_score_variance.html" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
            <p>
                When we consider commercial success, a pattern emerges. Directors who achieve higher box office revenues often strike a careful balance: their endings lean somewhat happier, while their overall variance remains moderate. This “sweet spot” suggests that while audiences appreciate innovation, they also seek comfort in familiarity. The subtle interplay between novelty and predictability can be the key to winning over mainstream viewers.
            </p>

            <h4>Audience Reception vs. Narrative Choices</h4>
            <iframe src="../assets/img/rq3/director_avg_score_vs_score_variance_vote_average.html" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
            <p>
                Surprisingly, audience ratings don’t strongly correlate with a specific narrative style. High approval scores arise from a range of storytelling choices. This finding indicates that a director’s reputation and execution can transcend simple formulas of happiness or darkness. In other words, strong filmmaking craft—be it comedic, dramatic, hopeful, or bleak—can resonate powerfully, regardless of the chosen emotional endpoint.
