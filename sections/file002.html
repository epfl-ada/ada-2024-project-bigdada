                Discovering the Evolution of Movie Endings Through Time
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                <b>Have you ever wondered how movie endings have transformed over the decades?</b> 
                By analyzing movies across different eras, we can uncover fascinating patterns in how filmmakers 
                have chosen to conclude their stories—whether with joy and resolution or tragedy and ambiguity.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                The relationship between <b>happy endings</b> and <b>time</b> offers a lens through which we can examine cultural evolution. 
                Do certain decades stand out as particularly <span style="color: #a5673f; font-weight: bold;">optimistic</span>—or 
                <span style="color: #7f4c33; font-weight: bold;">pessimistic</span>—in their cinematic storytelling?
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                In this exploration, we will delve into trends that reveal how the tone of movie conclusions has changed over time. 
                To begin, we’ll analyze the overall trend in <b>happy ending scores</b> across different periods, identifying broad patterns 
                and potential anomalies that may hold deeper meaning.
            </p>
        
            <h4 style="color: #a5673f; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 30px;">Overall Trend Across Time: First Observations</h4>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                The first graph provides an overview of how happy ending scores—measured by their mean and median values—have evolved over the years. 
                Movies are grouped into adjustable <b>year bins</b>, allowing for a dynamic exploration of these trends: you can interact with the bin size slider  
                to uncover both detailed and broad trends!
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                This visualization goes beyond the scores themselves by including the <b>number of movies produced per bin</b>. 
                This additional layer offers insight into the ebb and flow of film production across time, helping us contextualize 
                the patterns observed in happy endings. <b>Note:</b> bins with fewer than 100 movies are excluded from the analysis 
                to ensure statistical reliability.
            </p>
        
            <div id="graph-container" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
                <iframe src="..\assets\img\interactive_bin_plot.html" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" style="border: 3px solid #a5673f; border-radius: 10px;"></iframe>
            </div>
        
        <div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #4d2e24; margin: 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #fdf5e6; border: 2px solid #a5673f; border-radius: 10px;">
            <h4 style="color: #a5673f; text-decoration: underline;">Intriguing Trends in Movie Endings Over Time</h4>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                From this first plot, several <b>intriguing trends</b> emerge. 
                The distribution of movies across bins is far from uniform, with a <b>surge in films released between 1980 and 2009</b>, peaking around 2006-2007. 
                As for the <span style="color: #a5673f; font-weight: bold;">happy ending scores</span>, the variation is modest, consistently leaning toward slightly positive values. 
                Interestingly, when using a higher bin size, a general <b>U-shaped trend</b> becomes apparent: scores start relatively high in the early 20th century, 
                progressively decline through the mid-century, bottoming out around the 1970s, before climbing back up to brighter days by 2013. 
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                <b>Smaller bin sizes</b> reveal intricate patterns of ups and downs, highlighting local variations that are smoothed out with larger bins. 
                Yet, through it all, one consistent pattern shines through: <span style="color: #7f4c33; font-weight: bold;">happy endings remain the reigning champions of cinema.</span> 
                There is no period where the majority of movies lean toward sad or tragic conclusions. 
                Even in the darkest times, it seems audiences—and filmmakers—prefer a <b>silver lining</b>.

            <h4 style="color: #a5673f; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 30px;">Delving Deeper: The Turning Point Analysis</h4>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                Now that we've explored the overall trend in happy ending scores over time, it's time to <b>dig deeper</b> and statistically investigate this 
                macro-level temporal effect. Specifically, we aim to determine whether significant changes in scores occur <b>before and after a key moment in history</b>—a so-called <b>“Turning Point.”</b> 
                Do happy endings become more prevalent, or do they take a nosedive into gloominess after a specific year? 
                Such changes might reflect broader <span style="color: #a5673f; font-weight: bold;">historical, cultural, or societal transformations</span>. 
                Think of it as our attempt to find the cinematic equivalent of <b>“pre-war optimism”</b> or <b>“post-disco realism.”</b>
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                To test this, we’ll use the <b>Mann-Whitney U test</b> (no, it’s not the name of a secret agent, though it sounds like one). 
                This <span style="color: #a5673f; font-weight: bold;">non-parametric statistical test</span> allows us to compare the distributions of two groups—in our case, happy ending scores before and after a selected Turning Point.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                You’re not stuck with just one Turning Point, though! By <b>varying the threshold year</b>, we can get a broader or more fine-grained understanding of 
                when significant differences in scores emerge and pinpoint the cinematic milestones where <b>happy endings took a turn</b>. 
                <span style="color: #a5673f; font-weight: bold;">Let’s have a look at the results!</span>

        <h4 style="color: #a5673f; text-decoration: underline;">Detective Work: Addressing Statistical Challenges</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            <b>But wait, Sherlock, there’s a catch!</b> Before we pop the champagne for our statistical findings, let’s click on the magnifier glass 
            to dig deeper into what groups we just compared in our tests.
        </p>
    
        <div id="plot-toggle-container" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <button id="plot-toggle-button" onclick="togglePlots()" class="cartoon-magnifier">
                <i class="fas fa-search"></i> <!-- Magnifier glass icon -->
            </button>
        </div>
    
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            <b>Did you notice the group sizes?</b> We might have a couple of issues here that could raise some red flags. Let’s investigate!
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            First of all, we’re comparing groups of movies that are vastly different in size. This imbalance is particularly glaring when comparing groups 
            formed at the extremes—before the first decades of the 20th century or after the last ones. From the hint, it becomes clear that these groups 
            are <b style="color: #a5673f;">highly imbalanced</b>. 
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            <b>Why does this matter, you ask?</b> Well, when one group has significantly more data points than the other, the larger group dominates the statistical test, 
            potentially skewing the results.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            The second issue arises when we compare p-values from multiple statistical tests, each using a different <b>“Turning Point.”</b> Even if we attempt to balance 
            the groups by downsampling the larger one, we still end up with groups of varying sizes across tests. This inconsistency makes it tricky to draw reliable 
            comparisons between p-values. The tests might reflect not just differences in the data, but also <b style="color: #7f4c33;">differences in group size</b>.
        </p>
    
        <h4 style="color: #a5673f; margin-top: 30px;">A Robust Solution</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            To address these challenges, we’ll employ a more robust strategy. For each Turning Point, we’ll compare groups of <b>similar sizes</b>, both pre- and post-Turning Point. 
            To achieve this, we’ll set a minimum sample size and downsample the larger group to match the smaller one.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            <b>But wait, there’s more!</b> For very large groups, we’ll apply <b style="color: #a5673f;">bootstrap sampling</b> to maintain statistical power. 
            Bootstrap sampling allows us to repeatedly sample subsets from the larger group, ensuring our comparisons remain fair while leveraging as much data as possible.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            Finally, after we’ve examined the results using a different number of thresholds, one pattern stands out: <b style="color: #a5673f;">the period from 1970 to 2008</b> consistently 
            shows significant differences. To avoid repeating tests for every single year and to focus on broader trends, we’ll limit our analysis to Turning Points spaced 
            by decades, from 1930 to 2010.
        </p>
    
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; color: #7f4c33;">
            Let’s move forward with these adjustments! After all, even the best detective needs the right tools!

            <h4 style="color: #a5673f; text-decoration: underline;">Robust Evidence and Remaining Intrigues</h4>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                The results seem to align closely with what we observed previously, but <b style="color: #7f4c33;">some dates are no longer statistically significant!</b> 
                It looks like we’ve identified some intruders in our earlier findings. The remaining dates, however, provide much more robust evidence. 
                This gives us stronger proof that a <b>significant shift in movie endings</b> began around the 1980s and has persisted ever since.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                Interestingly, the lack of significance in the most recent decade might be due to <b>sample size issues</b>, as we discussed earlier. 
                Nevertheless, we can reasonably conclude that the major shift in the distribution of happy ending scores started in the 1980s and has continued steadily into more recent years.
            </p>
        
            <h4 style="color: #a5673f; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 20px;">Digging Deeper: Effect Sizes and Group Means</h4>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                But in what direction did this change occur? To dig deeper, we calculated the <b>Rank Biserial Correlation (RBC)</b>, 
                a metric that measures the effect size of the observed change in the distribution. For the significant p-values, the RBC effect sizes hover around <b>0.07</b>—not a groundbreaking shift, 
                but enough to suggest a subtle pattern. Additionally, the confidence intervals are quite wide, hinting at some variability in the results. 
                Despite these limitations, the effects remain <b style="color: #7f4c33;">statistically significant</b> and provide a reliable starting point for further investigation.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                We didn’t stop there! Instead of focusing solely on distribution differences, we also explored changes in <b>group means</b> before and after our Turning Points. 
                Using <b>Welch’s tests</b> and calculating <b>Cohen’s d</b>—a well-known effect size metric for comparing group means—we discovered a similar trend. 
                For instance, <b>mean happy ending scores increased</b> from <b style="color: #a5673f;">0.049 before 1990</b> to <b style="color: #a5673f;">0.068 after 1990</b>. 
                While these numbers might not scream “happily ever after,” they still reveal a consistent, gradual shift.
            </p>
        
            <h4 style="color: #a5673f; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 20px;">What Does This Mean?</h4>
           
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                These metrics suggest that <b>happy ending scores</b> have seen a modest but steady increase since the 1980s.
                But <b>why might this shift have happened?</b> Of course, correlation doesn’t imply causation, but that doesn’t stop us from some educated speculation! 
                Could this trend be linked to <b>global events, cultural movements, or economic changes?</b> The 1980s, for example, marked the easing of Cold War tensions, 
                a wave of technological optimism, and the rise of blockbuster cinema. Perhaps these factors inspired stories designed to leave audiences feeling good. 
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                Additionally, <b>economic growth and globalization</b> may have played a role in uplifting narratives—happy endings tend to resonate better with larger, diverse audiences. 
                Or maybe Hollywood simply figured out that optimistic conclusions sell more tickets. These are questions that will be explored later, as we continue to analyze the factors 
                shaping the ending of a movie. Whatever the reason, movies (ever so slightly) leaned toward brighter endings, 
                giving audiences a reason to leave the theater smiling.
            </p>
        
            <h4 style="color: #a5673f; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 20px;">A Case Still Open</h4>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                Despite these intriguing patterns, it’s challenging to pin this change on any single event or trend. Our analysis is based on binary comparisons 
                (pre- and post-Turning Points), making it difficult to isolate specific causes. More analyses have been performed to try to crack the secret of 
                the <b>evolution across time of happy ending movies</b>, but they’ve all hit dead ends, leaving us with nothing more than cinematic breadcrumbs. 
                For those curious detectives, the details of these additional analyses can be quietly found in a result notebook. 
                For now, the exact reason behind this shift remains a mystery.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-weight: bold; color: #7f4c33; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                One thing’s for sure: Sherlock, we’re going to need more clues to crack this case. Stay tuned!
