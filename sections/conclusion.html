            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
       

            <p>
                This study has revealed several fascinating trends regarding movie endings, their relationship with <strong>cultural</strong>, <strong>economic</strong>, and <strong>geopolitical</strong> events, as well as the practices of <strong>production studios</strong> and <strong>film genres</strong>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                On one hand, we observed a modest increase in <strong>"happy endings"</strong> since the 1980s, possibly linked to global shifts such as the <strong>end of the Cold War</strong>, <strong>globalization</strong>, and the rise of <strong>blockbuster cinema</strong>. These changes may reflect a growing demand for <strong>optimistic narratives</strong> that resonate with larger, more diverse audiences. On the other hand, the study found that <strong>audience approval scores</strong> are not necessarily correlated with a specific type of ending, but rather with the <strong>director's ability</strong> to craft the story, whether it ends joyfully or darkly.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Directors who achieve higher <strong>commercial success</strong> seem to have struck a delicate balance: their endings tend to lean somewhat happier, while maintaining <strong>moderate overall variance</strong>. This "sweet spot" suggests that audiences appreciate <strong>innovation</strong>, but also seek comfort in <strong>familiarity</strong>. However, some directors stand out by creating more marked <strong>emotional extremes</strong>, crafting either uplifting narratives or embracing <strong>ambiguity</strong> and <strong>tragedy</strong>, leaving viewers with lingering thoughts.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This diversity in narrative approach shows that while the <strong>ending form</strong> plays a role, a director’s <strong>reputation</strong> and <strong>filmmaking craft</strong> can transcend simple formulas of happiness or sadness.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <strong>Production studios</strong> also play a significant role in shaping movie endings, with companies like <strong>Hammer Production</strong> standing out for their preference for more complex, melancholic endings, in contrast to Hollywood studios like <strong>Walt Disney</strong> or <strong>Fox 2000</strong>, which favor happier conclusions. Additionally, certain regions, such as <strong>South Korea</strong>, <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, and <strong>Italy</strong>, tend to produce films with more <strong>nuanced endings</strong>, highlighting the strong influence of local culture on narrative choices.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <strong>Film genres</strong>, such as <strong>romantic comedies</strong> and <strong>horror movies</strong>, also show significant differences in their endings, underlining the diverse expectations and conventions associated with each genre. Furthermore, while <strong>film length</strong> seems to influence the type of ending, this relationship requires further research to better understand its exact implications.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                In conclusion, this analysis offers an insightful overview of the <strong>evolution</strong> of movie endings and their interaction with various <strong>cultural</strong>, <strong>economic</strong>, and <strong>industrial factors</strong>. However, much remains to be explored in order to fully understand the underlying reasons behind these trends and their impact on <strong>audience preferences</strong>.
            </p>
            <p><em>And so, the case of the movie endings continues to unfold, with many more clues to discover. Until next time, detective, thank you and farewell as we embark on new adventures!</em></p>
