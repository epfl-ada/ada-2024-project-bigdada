## Overview

1. **Readme.md**: This README file provides an overview of the project proposal (up to 1000 words). Please ensure the following sections are included:

   - **Title**  

   - **Abstract**  
     A brief description (approximately 150 words) outlining the projectâ€™s idea and goals. This section should explain the motivation behind the project, the story you intend to convey, and why it is relevant or interesting.

   - **Research Questions**  
     A clear list of research questions that the project aims to address.

   - **Proposed Additional Datasets (if any)**  
     If you plan to use additional datasets, list them here, along with your approach to acquiring, managing, processing, and enriching them. Demonstrate that you have reviewed the relevant documentation and examples, and have a realistic expectation of what the data entails (considering factors like size and format).

   - **Methods**  
     An outline of the proposed methods and approaches you will use to address your research questions.

   - **Proposed Timeline**  
     A timeline for project milestones, leading up to the final submission.

   - **Team Organization**  
     A breakdown of roles and responsibilities within the team, along with a list of internal milestones up until Project Milestone P3.

   - **Questions for TAs (optional)**  
     If you have specific questions for the teaching assistants regarding the project, include them here.

2. **GitHub Repository Structure**:  
   The GitHub repository should be organized and contain all code for initial analyses and data handling. Use this repository as a template for structure.

3. **Notebook for Initial Results**:  
   Prepare a Jupyter Notebook that presents the initial results of your analysis. This notebook will be assessed on:
   
   - **Correctness**: Accurate implementation of methods and analyses.
   - **Code Quality**: Well-organized, readable, and efficient code.
   - **Textual Descriptions**: Clear and concise explanations of your results and methods.
   
   The main analysis logic should be contained in external scripts or modules that are referenced within the notebook.
