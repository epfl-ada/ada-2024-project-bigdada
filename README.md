 **End of a Movie: Predictable or Not?**  

   - **Abstract**  
     This project explores the extent to which a movie’s ending can be predicted using various factors from our dataset, such as genre, actors, directors, time period, and other metrics like ratings and box office performance. We aim to analyze patterns and correlations that may reveal underlying trends in movie endings and examine how societal and historical shifts might influence these trends. Additionally, we will explore variations in endings across different countries, hypothesizing that cultural factors play a role in shaping audience expectations, consequently, the types of endings filmmakers choose. Ultimately, this project seeks to answer: can we foresee a film's ending before watching it? This exploration offers valuable insights into audience preferences, cultural influences, and the changing dynamics of the film industry.

   - **Research Questions**

     To guide our analysis and improve our ability to predict movie endings, we will address the following questions:
     
     - How does the genre of a movie influence the type of ending it has (happy, tragic, open-ended)?
       Certain genres may have a higher likelihood of happy or tragic endings. This question will help us understand how genre conventions shape audience expectations.
       
     - How have happy and tragic endings evolved over time?
       By analyzing movie endings across different time periods, we aim to identify historical trends and examine how societal shifts might influence the tone of a film’s conclusion.
       
     - What role do key personnel (actors and directors) play in shaping a movie's ending?
       Do certain actors or directors have a preference for particular types of endings, and do their choices influence the overall predictability of a movie’s outcome?
       
     - Is there a correlation between a movie’s ending and its success (ratings, box office revenue, etc.)?
       We will explore whether happy or tragic endings have any impact on a movie's popularity or financial performance.
     
     - Do cultural differences influence the type of movie ending? Are there notable differences in the types of endings preferred or produced in different countries, suggesting cultural factors at play?
    
     - Do budget and production scale affect the type of ending chosen?
      Exploring whether high-budget films tend to favor certain endings (e.g., happy endings for wider audience appeal) could reveal if financial considerations impact storytelling choices.

     - How do movie endings vary by film length ?
       This question would explore whether movies of different lengths (e.g., short vs. feature-length) tend to have different types of endings.

     - Do sequels or franchise movies follow different patterns in their endings compared to standalone films?
       Investigating whether franchise movies are more likely to have open-ended or happy endings to encourage future installments could reveal a unique trend in storytelling within cinematic universes.
       
     - Is there a connection between production studios and the type of endings their movies typically have?
Certain studios might have brand identities tied to specific types of storytelling. For example, do studios known for family-friendly content favor happy endings?



   - **Proposed Additional Datasets (if any)**  
     If you plan to use additional datasets, list them here, along with your approach to acquiring, managing, processing, and enriching them. Demonstrate that you have reviewed the relevant documentation and examples, and have a realistic expectation of what the data entails (considering factors like size and format).

   - **Methods**  
     
     To answer our research questions and evaluate the predictability of movie endings, we will employ a combination of data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques. Our methods will include the following steps:

     Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
We will begin by cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, standardize categorical fields (e.g., genre, country), and normalize numerical data (e.g., ratings, box office revenues).

     Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA will help us identify initial patterns and trends. We will use visualization techniques to understand distributions and relationships, such as the prevalence of happy vs. tragic endings across genres, time periods, and countries. We will also examine the evolution of movie endings over time, highlighting shifts or patterns that may align with societal changes or cinematic trends.

     Statistical Analysis
To evaluate relationships between movie characteristics and ending types, we will apply statistical tests. For example, chi-square tests could help determine if certain genres are more likely to have specific endings, and correlation analysis will help assess the relationship between ending types and success metrics (e.g., ratings).
We may also use time-series analysis to examine how endings have evolved over time, as well as cross-country comparisons to assess cultural influences on endings.

     Feature Engineering
     We will choose features from the dataset that are potentially predictive of movie endings. This may include genre-based features, director and actor popularity, box office success, ratings, and country-specific indicators.

     Predictive Modeling
Using machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines), we will attempt to predict the type of ending based on available features. We will train and test our models on a portion of the dataset to evaluate their predictive accuracy.
We may experiment with ensemble models (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) to improve accuracy and interpretability, and perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
